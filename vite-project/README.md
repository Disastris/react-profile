# React Profile

## Description

Created this profile with React to show my understanding of the program made by Facebook. With this assignment I learned how to make a more cleaner looking profile then when I first started the coding program. This profile as the name suggests was made mostly with React, Tailwind and some CSS.

## Installation

## Credits

Credits for this assignment go to the tutor Weng Fei Fung who, as always, been such a big help with helping me to understand this assignment!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
