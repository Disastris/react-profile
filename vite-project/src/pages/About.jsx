        Hi, My name is Santiago Garcia-Chavez. I am a born and raised Austinite
        and love how big the city is growing. I'm considered by many as a
        unicorn, unlike other Austinites I have stayed in Austin to stay close
        to family. They have always been a great support system and I wish to
        grow with them. I am always craving new experiences and knowledge
        because they lead to discovering new passions. People have described me
        as creative, charismatic, and a jack of all trades. I am a unique
        individual that always finds the fun side of doing work. I am able to
        adapt and interface effectively with a wide variety of personnel with my
        experiences working in diverse environments. I know how and when it is
        important to act professionally, and I believe the greatest achievement
        in life is self-growth.
