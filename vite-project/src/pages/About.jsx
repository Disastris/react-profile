          Hi, My name is Santiago Garcia-Chavez. I am a born and raised
          Austinite and love how big the city is growing. I'm considered by many
          as a unicorn, unlike other Austinites I have stayed in Austin to stay
          close to family. They have always been a great support system and I
          wish to grow with them.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-5">
          I am always craving new experiences and knowledge because they lead to
          discovering new passions. People have described me as creative,
          charismatic, and a jack of all trades. I am a unique individual that
          always finds the fun side of doing work. I am able to adapt and
          interface effectively with a wide variety of personnel with my
          experiences working in diverse environments. I know how and when it is
          important to act professionally, and I believe the greatest
          achievement in life is self-growth.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-5">
          I am proficient in front end skills like React.js and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-5">
          In backend i know how to use Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and
          Mongoose.
